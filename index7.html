      <p>We have to acknowledge this fact:“It’s a more than one India”. And its
not an easy task of our chief ministers if we consider the individual
state; as their population is ever more than the average population of
the European country and my times of African Nation. Also we have such a
huge cultural diversity!</p>
<p>It presents a huge opportunity to every type of business, because you
anyway find market for you product/service. Important thing is to find
out your target market.</p>
<p>Back to our focus on Rural segment. Again our target market is very
diverse. Gap between urban and rural is there. It makes confuse to
decide on which type of media should we use to communicate our brand!
Statistics reveal that while the number of rural consumers earning about
a dollar a day would come down from 400 million to 250 million by 2020,
the number of consumers earning over \$5 a day would have catapulted
from 50 million today to 150 million by then. This represents a huge
opportunity for marketers to increase their rural presence.</p>
<p>Example HUL’s 40% revenue is coming from rural. Its total revenue is
about Rs. 18,000 Cr. And these guys believes that in next 4-5 yrs it
will be more than 50%. Anyway, only idiots want to miss-out such
opportunity.</p>
<p>But question is how?</p>
<p>Traditional models are very costly. Example; Bank can’t open their
branch in every village and Malls can’t be opened in every district!</p>
<p>Answer to this is problem is already given by C.K. Prahalad. His Idea
was that “we have to create entrepreneurs at the bottom of pyramid!”</p>
<p>Every company should remind this line to every top executives in every
meeting. Because it has to be on both side, company side is already
there but other(Rural); are we really making them able to work,
increasing their skills, and initiatives from their side to enter.</p>
<p>These initiatives like stores/franchisees  run by local employees(full
ownership by locals/in partnership with company/financed with govt./
others). Then only innovations can be possible. And you should be open
to listen them!</p>
<p>Innovations in Marketing mix must be there! Like products will be
specially designed for rural market. Their promotion will be different
than in Urban. For example Laptop/PC/Desktop manufactures have to go
into the village and organize camps in district schools to increase
awareness the importance of Computer education and teach elementary
education of Computer to school children.</p>
<p>Anyway, sure we will see more and more innovative ideas in future!</p>
<ul>
<li>remember: “Create Entrepreneurs at the Bottom of pyramid”</li>

in my blog.</p>
<p>Also i find great software to help me in writing my blog. That is
"Windows Live Writer"! Its a great software, it synchronizes my offline
writings. It helps me because often while typing in my blog my net

      <p>just go through the the charts given below.<br />
[gallery]</p>
<p>The effect can be seen on Dollar which has share of 71% as a world's
reserve currency in 2001 which has fallen to 61% in 2010.</p>
<p>To support the supply on US Dollar in market others who has dollar as a
reserve or doing their business with Dollar currency have to do the
same, increase the money supply. (Or leave the dollar as a form of
reserve currency)</p>
<p>other measure can be taken to control the inflation are:<br />
1. Setting up commodity standards<br />
2. "Hidden inflation" are there which are not measured such as black
market transactions and Hidden quality deterioration; work on them.<br />
3. Improve efficiency on the supply chain so that shortages will not be
created.</p>

      <p>Quick Update:<br />
After the post crisis era US govt is facing higher deficits and
increasing external debt.<br />
Please be careful that US gov. may take decisions about
"Debasement/Devaluation" of its Currency Dollar.<br />
So that it can reduce its external debt. Another result this will be
higher inflation in America.</p>
<p>This practice is very common in history.<br />
But this may turn like the "1976 sterling crisis". at that time we have
to say that "Good-Bye Great Britain". And this made the way to rise of
America as a leader of our world.</p>
<p>Similarly if it happen with Dollar then it we will say "Good-Bye
America"</p>
<p>and the new leader will lead the world, of-course your guessed it
right:its CHINA.</p>
<p>Anyway interesting thing is to observe the whole process.</p>
